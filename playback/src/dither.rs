// Dithering lowers digital-to-analog conversion ("requantization") error,
// linearizing output, lowering distortion and replacing it with a constant,
// fixed noise level, which is more pleasant to the ear than the distortion.
//
// Guidance:
//
//  * On S24, S24_3 and S24, the default is to use triangular dithering.
//    Depending on personal preference you may use Gaussian dithering instead;
//    it's not as good objectively, but it may be preferred subjectively if
//    you are looking for a more "analog" sound akin to tape hiss.
//
//  * Advanced users who know that they have a DAC without noise shaping have
//    a third option: high-passed dithering, which is like triangular dithering
//    except that it moves dithering noise up in frequency where it is less
//    audible. Note: 99% of DACs are of delta-sigma design with noise shaping,
//    so unless you have a multibit / R2R DAC, or otherwise know what you are
//    doing, this is not for you.
//
//  * Don't dither or shape noise on S32 or F32. On F32 it's not supported
//    anyway (there are no integer conversions and so no rounding errors) and
//    on S32 the noise level is so far down that it is simply inaudible even
//    after volume normalisation and control.
