## [0.5.0] - 2024-10-15

This version is be a major departure from the architecture up until now. It
focuses on implementing the "new Spotify API". This  means moving large parts
of the Spotify protocol from Mercury to HTTP. A lot of this was reverse
engineered before by @devgianlu of librespot-java. It was long overdue that we
started implementing it too, not in the least because new features like the
hopefully upcoming Spotify HiFi depend on it.

Splitting up the work on the new Spotify API, v0.5.0 brings HTTP-based file
downloads and metadata access. Implementing the "dealer" (replacing the current
Mercury-based SPIRC message bus with WebSockets, also required for social plays)
is a large and separate effort, slated for some later release.

While at it, we are taking the liberty to do some major refactoring to make
librespot more robust. Consequently not only the Spotify API changed but large
parts of the librespot API too. For downstream maintainers, we realise that it
can be a lot to move from the current codebase to this one, but believe us it
will be well worth it.

All these changes are likely to introduce new bugs as well as some regressions.
We appreciate all your testing and contributions to the repository:

- [all] `chrono` replaced with `time` (breaking)
- [all] `time` updated (CVE-2020-26235)
- [all] Improve lock contention and performance (breaking)
- [all] Use a single `player` instance. Eliminates occasional `player` and
  `audio backend` restarts, which can cause issues with some playback
  configurations.

- [connect] Add `Clone, Defaut` traits to `spirc` contexts
- [connect] Autoplay contexts are now retrieved with the `spclient` (breaking)
- [contrib] Updated Docker image
- [core] Message listeners are registered before authenticating. As a result
  there now is a separate `Session::new` and subsequent `session.connect`.
  (breaking)
- [core] `ConnectConfig` moved out of `core` into `connect` (breaking)
- [core] `client_id` for `get_token` moved to `SessionConfig` (breaking)
- [core] Mercury code has been refactored for better legibility (breaking)

- [core] Report actual platform data on login
- [core] Support `Session` authentication with a Spotify access token
- [core] `Credentials.username` is now an `Option` (breaking)

- [core] Each access point connection now timesout after 3 seconds.
- [core] Listen on both IPV4 and IPV6 on non-windows hosts
- [main] `autoplay {on|off}` now acts as an override. If unspecified, `librespot`
  now follows the setting in the Connect client that controls it. (breaking)

- [metadata] Playlists are moved to the `playlist4_external` protobuf (breaking)
- [metadata] Handle playlists that are sent with microsecond-based timestamps

  downloads even if librespot doesn't use that for playback itself.
- [core] Support downloading of lyrics
- [core] Support parsing `SpotifyId` for local files
- [core] Support parsing `SpotifyId` for named playlists

- [main] Add all player events to `player_event_handler.rs`
- [main] Add an event worker thread that runs async to the main thread(s) but
  sync to itself to prevent potential data races for event consumers
- [metadata] All metadata fields in the protobufs are now exposed (breaking)
- [oauth] Standalone module to obtain Spotify access token using OAuth authorization code flow.

## [0.4.2] - 2022-07-29

Besides a couple of small fixes, this point release is mainly to blacklist the
ap-gew4 and ap-gue1 access points that caused librespot to fail to playback
anything.

Development will now shift to the new HTTP-based API, targeted for a future
v0.5.0 release. The new-api branch will therefore be promoted to dev. This is a
major departure from the old API and although it brings many exciting new
things, it is also likely to introduce new bugs and some regressions.

Long story short, this v0.4.2 release is the most stable that librespot has yet
to offer. But, unless anything big comes up, it is also intended as the last
release to be based on the old API. Happy listening.

### Changed
- [playback] `pipe`: Better error handling
- [playback] `subprocess`: Better error handling

### Added
- [core] `apresolve`: Blacklist ap-gew4 and ap-gue1 access points that cause channel errors
- [playback] `pipe`: Implement stop

### Fixed

## [0.4.1] - 2022-05-23

This release fixes dependency issues when installing from crates.

### Changed
- [chore] The MSRV is now 1.56

### Fixed
- [playback] Fixed dependency issues when installing from crate

## [0.4.0] - 2022-05-21

Note: This version was yanked, because a corrupt package was uploaded and failed
to install.

This is a polishing release, adding a few little extras and improving on many
thers. We had to break a couple of API's to do so, and therefore bumped the
minor version number. v0.4.x may be the last in series before we migrate from
the current channel-based Spotify backend to a more HTTP-based backend.
Targeting that major effort for a v0.5 release sometime, we intend to maintain
v0.4.x as a stable branch until then.

### Changed
- [chore] The MSRV is now 1.53
- [contrib] Hardened security of the `systemd` service units
- [core] `Session`: `connect()` now returns the long-term credentials
- [core] `Session`: `connect()` now accepts a flag if the credentails should be stored via the cache
- [main] Different option descriptions and error messages based on what backends are enabled at build time
- [playback] More robust dynamic limiter for very wide dynamic range (breaking)
- [playback] `alsa`: improve `--device ?` output for the Alsa backend
- [playback] `gstreamer`: create own context, set correct states and use sync handler
- [playback] `pipe`: create file if it doesn't already exist
- [playback] `Sink`: `write()` now receives ownership of the packet (breaking)

### Added
- [main] Enforce reasonable ranges for option values (breaking)
- [main] Add the ability to parse environment variables
- [main] Log now emits warning when trying to use options that would otherwise have no effect
- [main] Verbose logging now logs all parsed environment variables and command line arguments (credentials are redacted)
- [main] Add a `-q`, `--quiet` option that changes the logging level to WARN
- [main] Add `disable-credential-cache` flag (breaking)
- [main] Add a short name for every flag and option
- [playback] `pulseaudio`: set the PulseAudio name to match librespot's device name via `PULSE_PROP_application.name` environment variable (user set env var value takes precedence) (breaking)
- [playback] `pulseaudio`: set icon to `audio-x-generic` so we get an icon instead of a placeholder via `PULSE_PROP_application.icon_name` environment variable (user set env var value takes precedence) (breaking)
- [playback] `pulseaudio`: set values to: `PULSE_PROP_application.version`, `PULSE_PROP_application.process.binary`, `PULSE_PROP_stream.description`, `PULSE_PROP_media.software` and `PULSE_PROP_media.role` environment variables (user set env var values take precedence) (breaking)

### Fixed
- [connect] Don't panic when activating shuffle without previous interaction
- [core] Removed unsafe code (breaking)
- [main] Fix crash when built with Avahi support but Avahi is locally unavailable
- [main] Prevent hang when discovery is disabled and there are no credentials or when bad credentials are given

- [playback] Adhere to ReplayGain spec when calculating gain normalisation factor
- [playback] `alsa`: make `--volume-range` overrides apply to Alsa softvol controls

### Removed

- [playback] Improve dithering CPU usage by about 33%

### Fixed
- [connect] Partly fix behavior after last track of an album/playlist

## [0.3.0] - 2021-10-13

### Added

### Changed
- [audio, playback] Moved `VorbisDecoder`, `VorbisError`, `AudioPacket`, `PassthroughDecoder`, `PassthroughError`, `DecoderError`, `AudioDecoder` and the `convert` module from `librespot-audio` to `librespot-playback`.

- [playback] `alsamixer`: query card dB range for the volume control unless specified otherwise
- [playback] `alsamixer`: use `--device` name for `--mixer-card` unless specified otherwise
- [playback] `player`: consider errors in `sink.start`, `sink.stop` and `sink.write` fatal and `exit(1)` (breaking)
- [playback] `player`: make `convert` and `decoder` public so you can implement your own `Sink`
- [playback] `player`: update default normalisation threshold to -2 dBFS
- [playback] `player`: default normalisation type is now `auto`

### Deprecated

### Fixed
