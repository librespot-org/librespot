# librespot
*librespot* is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables
applications to use Spotify's service, without using the official but
closed-source `libspotify`. Additionally, it will provide extra features
which are not available in the official library.

_Note: librespot only works with Spotify Premium. This will remain the case for the foreseeable future, as we are unlikely to work on implementing the features such as limited skips and adverts that would be required to make librespot compliant with free accounts._

## This fork
As the origin by [plietar](https://github.com/plietar/) is no longer actively maintained, this organisation and repository have been set up so that the project may be maintained and upgraded in the future.

# Documentation
Documentation is currently a work in progress.

There is some brief documentation on how the protocol works in the [docs](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/tree/master/docs) folder, and more general usage and compilation information is available on the [wiki](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki).

[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) also contains detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, compilation, and contributing guidelines.

If you wish to learn more about how librespot works overall, the best way is to simply read the code, and ask any questions you have in the Gitter chat linked above.

# Issues

If you run into a bug when using librespot, please search the existing issues before opening a new one. Chances are, we've encountered it before, and have provided a resolution. If not, please open a new one, and where possible, include the backtrace librespot generates on crashing, along with anything we can use to reproduce the issue, eg. the Spotify URI of the song that caused the crash.

# Building
Rust 1.30.0 or later is required to build librespot.

## Additional Dependencies
We recently switched to using [Rodio](https://github.com/tomaka/rodio) for audio playback by default, hence for macOS and Windows, you should just be able to clone and build librespot (with the command below).
For Linux, you will need to run the additional commands below, depending on your distro.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the following command will install these dependencies :
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev
```

On Fedora systems, the following command will install these dependencies :
```shell
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel make gcc
```

librespot currently offers the a selection of [audio backends](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends).
```
Rodio (default)
ALSA
PortAudio
PulseAudio
JACK
SDL
Pipe
```
Please check the corresponding [compiling wiki entry](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#dependencies) for backend specific dependencies.

Once you've installed the dependencies and cloned this repository you can build *librespot* with the default backend using Cargo.
```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
A sample program implementing a headless Spotify Connect receiver is provided.
Once you've built *librespot*, run it using :
```shell
target/release/librespot --name DEVICENAME
```

The above is a minimal example. Here is a more fully fledged one:
```shell
target/release/librespot -n "Librespot" -b 320 -c ./cache --enable-volume-normalisation --initial-volume 75 --device-type avr
```
The above command will create a receiver named ```Librespot```, with bitrate set to 320kbps, initial volume at 75%, with volume normalisation enabled, and the device displayed in the app as an Audio/Video Receiver. A folder named ```cache``` will be created/used in the current directory, and be used to cache audio data and credentials.

A full list of runtime options are available [here](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options)
